Requirements for the development build process:
===============================================

The following software must be installed:

  - http://git-scm.com/
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
  - C++ compiler and X11 development headers

The LucED git repository already contains modified versions of:

  - http://www.pcre.org/
  - http://www.lua.org/



Check out the LucED source code:
================================

Use the following commands to check out a LucED development 
repository:

   git clone git://git.berlios.de/luced
or
   git clone git://github.com/osch/luced.git
   


Build LucED in a development repository:
========================================

Simply invoke GNU-Make:

   cd editor
   make

This will invoke a configure script and build a LucED executable.

For building a debug executable the file sandbox.mk should contain 
the following line:

   CPP_DEFINES += -D DEBUG 



Invoke LucED:
=============

To open the file test.txt simply type:

   cd editor
   ./luced test.txt
   
LucED doesn't have a file selector, every file must be opened throw 
the shell command line.

If the current directory and the home directory  both have no 
directory named '.luced', a default '.luced' configuration directory 
is written on program invokation in the home directory.



Build a distributable tar.gz ball:
==================================

   cd editor
   make release
   cd release
   ./configure
   make dist
   
This will build a standard source tar ball that can be installed 
with the notorious command sequence:

   ./configure
   make
   make install
