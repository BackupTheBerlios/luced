Introduction
============

LucED is an [open source] text editor with a graphical [X11] user interface. 
Although the project has not published any official releases so far, you are welcome to 
play around with the current source code.

The principal aim of the LucED project is to develop a text editor with the following features:

  * A simple and minimalistic, but powerful user interface that is similar to the
    [NEdit] text editor, but does not depend on [Motif]
  * Fast and responsive user interface: e.g. syntax highlighting is done in
    the background and does not freeze the user interface, special handling to achieve 
    fast keyboard repeat rates
  * No dependencies on high-level [widget toolkits] in order to minimise the requirements 
    for the runtime system and to support slow network connections

The following features are already imlemented:
  
  * Embedded [Lua] programming language for scripting and configuration
  * Syntax highlighting configurable via [PCRE] regular expressions, similar to the 
    NEdit syntax highlighting but with the enhancement to use arbitrarily nested patterns
  * Full unicode support (works with UTF-8 internally)

Up to now, LucED doesn't have a menu bar or a file selector... so the intended audience
are users, who are working on the commandline ;-)



Building an official release
============================

Official LucED releases will be distributed as tar.gz archives, based on the 
widely used [GNU autotools] build system.

The tar.gz archive should not be used for development purposes, because it contains
generated C++ code.  
For development purposes a checked out git repository should be used (see below).

Requirements
------------

The following software must be installed:

  * *tar* program, e.g. [GNU Tar]
  * *gunzip* program, e.g. [GNU Gzip]
  * *sh* standard shell, e.g. [GNU Bash]
  * Any *make* program that is supported by the [GNU autotools], e.g.
    [GNU Make]
  * C++ compiler , e.g. [gcc] version 3.4 or higher
  * *libX11* with development headers
  * *libxpm* with development headers (optional)
  * *libiconv* with development headers (optional), e.g. [GNU libiconv]


Build instructions
------------------

If for example the tar.gz file has name *luced-0.01.tar.gz*, you can build and 
install LucED with the command sequence:

       gunzip luced-0.01.tar.gz
       tar xf luced-0.01.tar
       cd luced-0.01
       ./configure
       make
       make install
       
Configure options
-----------------

When invoking the *configure* script, consider the following commandline options:

  * *--disable-xpm*   disables the usage of libxpm for displaying icons. This
                      can improve performance on slow connections.

  * *--disable-iconv* disables the usage of libiconv for transforming
                      character encodings. If libiconv is disabled,
                      LucED only knows UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoding.



Building in a development sandbox
=================================

For development purposes, LucED should be build within a checked out [Git] 
repository. 

In this case the [GNU autotools] are only used for finding
the system configuration with autoconf (and for building the release tar.gz archive),
the build process itself is based on hand-written Makefiles.

Requirements
------------

The following software must be installed, if you want to build LucED within
a checked out Git repository:

  * [Git]
  * *sh* standard shell, e.g. [GNU Bash]
  * [GNU Make]
  * [GNU autoconf]
  * [GNU libtool]
  * [GNU automake]
  * C++ compiler
  * *libX11* with development headers
  * *libxpm* with development headers (optional)
  * *libiconv* with development headers (optional), e.g. [GNU libiconv]


Check out Git repository
------------------------

You can get the latest source code from 
[BerliOS] by using [Git] with the following 
commands:

       git clone git://git.berlios.de/luced
       cd luced 

Alternatively you may obtain the source code from the mirrored 
[github repository].

       git clone git://github.com/osch/luced.git
       cd luced 


Build instructions
------------------
   
Try the following commands for building LucED:

       cd editor
       make

Local build adjustments can be done in the file *sandbox.mk*, to override settings 
of the *Makefile*.

For building a debug executable, the file *sandbox.mk* should contain 
the following line:

       CPP_DEFINES += -D DEBUG 

*Configure* options can also be placed in the file *sandbox.mk*, e.g.:

       CONFIGURE_OPTS := --disable-xpm


Build a distributable tar.gz archive
------------------------------------

Build a distributable tar.gz ball with the following commands:

       make release
       cd release
       ./configure
       make dist
   
This will build a standard source tar.gz ball that can be installed 
with the notorious command sequence:

       ./configure
       make
       make install

This tar ball should not be used for development purposes, because it contains
generated C++ code.  
For development purposes a checked out git repository should be used.


Build problems
==============

Compilation has been tested with [gcc] versions 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

There may be problems with some C++ compilers, that do not fully support C++ templates.

If you have any problems, please contact the author via email: 
*oliver at luced dot de*.


Program invocation
==================

To open the file *test.txt* simply type:

       ./luced test.txt

   
LucED doesn't have a file selector, every file must be opened through
the shell command line.

If the current directory and the home directory  both have no 
directory named *.luced*, a default *.luced* configuration directory 
is written on program invocation in the home directory.
