You are welcome to play around with the current LucED source code.

Requirements
============

The following software must be installed, if you want to build LucED within
a checked out Git repository:

  * <http://git-scm.com/>
  * <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
  * <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
  * <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
  * <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
  * C++ compiler and X11 development headers


Check out Git repository
========================

You can get the latest source code from 
[BerliOS] by using [Git] with the following 
commands:

       git clone git://git.berlios.de/luced
       cd luced 

Alternatively you may obtain the source code from the mirrored 
[github repository].

       git clone git://github.com/osch/luced.git
       cd luced 


Build instructions
==================
   
Try the following commands for building LucED:

       cd editor
       make

   
See the file `Makefile` for possible adjustments for the
`sandbox.mk` file.

There may be some problems with some C++ compilers, that do not fully support C++ templates.  
Compilation has been tested with [gcc] versions 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.



Program invocation
==================

To open the file `test.txt` simply type:

       ./luced test.txt

   
LucED doesn't have a file selector, every file must be opened through
the shell command line.

If the current directory and the home directory  both have no 
directory named `.luced`, a default `.luced` configuration directory 
is written on program invocation in the home directory.


Build a distributable tar.gz ball
=================================

Build a distributable tar.gz ball with the following commands:

       make release
       cd release
       ./configure
       make dist
   
This will build a standard source tar ball that can be installed 
with the notorious command sequence:

       ./configure
       make
       make install

This tar ball should not be used for development purposes, because it contains
generated C++ code.  
For development purposes a checked out git repository should be used.
